# TODO:

- recreate db table with all of my clothes content
- Make clothes-planning function work end-to-end
- Refactor files to make readable
- Dockerize and make a flask (or fastapi) server so I can serve it as an endpoint

## BIG CHANGE:
- Figure out how to do userid provisioning on the backend so I can store "user" data
- Update DB schema to have my clothes all there (perhaps with hand annotations?)
- render website to plan outfits for Zubin's Closet **BIG WORK REQUIRED**
