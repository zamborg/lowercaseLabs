# Chatter

This is an example of a RAGGAR framework toolset

Chatter has an agent that writes duck-duck-go queries (using openai's api atm), queries duck-duck-go and then returns generated answers based on that content. There is nothing but ICL (fancy prompting) in this framework, but one can see how powerful it is. 

**Bing** and **BARD** both do this kind of query -> search -> generate answer pipelined work. 

### Use it, its fun :)
