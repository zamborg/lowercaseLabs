## On Update Frequency:

I push code much more frequently than I push readme's. I attempt to maintain decent README into this repo by using AI_README.md --> an AI generated readme. 

## gpt.sh
use `$gpt XXX` to use OpenAI's gpt3.5 for chat completion with a question. Nice to have in the commandline for debugging!

To use install jq:
`brew install jq`

### Tips?
- I highly recommend updating the prompt to make it as useful as possible for you.
  - I have my system information, sometimes I'll add what language I'm working in.
  - If you're having fun you can also play with branching statements in bash to give yourself different default prompts before your query gets passed in.
- I also recommend adding `-s` to the curl command if you don't like the curl load bar.
- Remove the linebreak if you have better eyes than I do ðŸ‘€
